1. Additional Server: Adding an extra server allows for the separation of components onto their own dedicated servers. This separation offers several benefits:
   - Improved Performance: By dedicating resources to specific components, such as web server, application server, and database, each component can utilize the server's resources efficiently, resulting in better overall performance.
   - Scalability: With each component on its own server, it becomes easier to scale individual components based on their specific requirements. For example, if the database server experiences increased load, it can be scaled independently without affecting the other components.

2. Load Balancer Cluster: Configuring the load balancer (HAproxy) as a cluster with the existing one provides high availability and ensures seamless traffic distribution. Here's why it's beneficial:
   - High Availability: In a cluster setup, if one load balancer fails, the other load balancer(s) in the cluster can seamlessly take over the traffic routing. This ensures that the service remains available even if one load balancer becomes unavailable.
   - Improved Performance: Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed. This results in better performance and response times for users.

3. Split Components onto Dedicated Servers: Separating the components onto their own servers offers several advantages:
   - Resource Isolation: Each component gets dedicated resources, preventing resource contention. This isolation ensures that one component's resource usage does not impact the performance of others.
   - Enhanced Security: By isolating components, the attack surface for each component is reduced. For example, compromising the web server should not affect the application server or database directly.
   - Scalability and Flexibility: Splitting components onto separate servers allows for independent scaling based on their specific needs. If one component requires more resources, it can be scaled up without affecting others.

By incorporating these additional elements, we achieve a more robust and scalable infrastructure. The additional server provides dedicated resources for each component, ensuring optimal performance. The load balancer cluster ensures high availability and load distribution, improving overall system reliability. Lastly, splitting components onto separate servers offers resource isolation, enhanced security, and scalability.
